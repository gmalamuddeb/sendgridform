# sendgridform v0.1
A simple contact form using sendgrid's api, and with a simple verification method using recaptcha.

## To Do List

- Add text verification (Maybe happy.js?)
- Concatenate php files into one
- Find a better solution to the non-validated form

## Apologies

To the purists of PHP, 
To the sorcerors of clean css, 
To the builders of truly good code, 
To the craftsmen of software...

As this is my first repo and collaboration ever for, surprisingly, something that I haven't yet seen posted anywhere.

## Thanks

To the good friends at Sendgrid for their demo on how to build the form.
